# APPLYING THE CONCEPT OF TRANSFER LEARNING FOR DOING FACE RECOGNITION USING A PRE-TRAINED MODEL "VGG16"
STEP1: Collect testing and training dataset of face images using opencv module.
STEP2: First we will create and then train our model using the pre-trained model "VGG16".We will download the weight of Imagenet and then apply the concept of Transfer Learning.
STEP3: Secondly, we will test the accuracy of our model.
STEP4: At last, we will write the code for face recognition in which we will load our above created model and then recognise the faces.
